Pillar v0.1 -- PHP Framework for Mediawiki
-----------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:

  * PHP 5.2 or newer (not tested on other versions - I expect most
    (if not all) PHP 5.x releases will work.
  * The wiki this is used for should be running at least MediaWiki
    version 1.14 and have the API enabled.  Other versions (1.13
    especially) may work partially but are unlikely to work fully.
    Failure will not be graceful!
  * At least one out of colordiff, diff and wikidiff2 must be installed
    if you want to do edit-previews.

Installation:

  * Copy the files in Pillar to an appropriate directory.

Included files:

  * class.mwrequest.php: a class to make requests to a MediaWiki site
  * class.mwsite.php   : a class to store and retrieve information from a MediaWiki site
  * class.page.php     : a class to get and modify pages from a MediaWiki site
  * class.pillar.php   : a class to run the application and manage open sites
  * class.request.php  : a class to make non-MediaWiki HTTP requests
  * class.site.php     : a class to store and retrieve information from a non-MediaWiki site

Current limitations:

  * Can only do what the API can do, aside from diffs and uploads.

Example:

<?php
define('PILLAR','PILLAR'); 
/* Every script implementing Pillar must start with this definition.*/

$pillar = new Pillar('enwiki','en.wikipedia.org','w/api.php','Sambot','password');
/* A new Pillar instance is created, containing a MWSite instance identified by the string 
   'enwiki'.  The user specified is logged in.*/

$page = new Page($pillar->cursite,'User:Sambot');
/* A new Page instance is created, containing information and the text of the page specified.
   $pillar->cursite is a reference to the current site.*/

$page->put('New text','Edit summary,true);
/* Make an edit. The third argument is boolean true or false setting whether the edit is
   minor.*/

$pillar->add_site('bbc','www.bbc.co.uk','');
/* Make a new Site object, identified by the string 'bbc', at the BBC's homepage.*/

$request = new Request($pillar->get_site('bbc'),array(),false);
/* Make a new GET request (set the third argument to true to do POST) with no query
   specified on the site identified by 'bbc'.*/

print ($request->get_body());
/* Print the body of the request (i.e. leaving out HTTP headers, which are in an array
   accessible through $request->get_headers().*/

?>
